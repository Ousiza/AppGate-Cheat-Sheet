== DNS
* IdP	Set on the adapter on the client, used by the OS of the client. Resolvers differ on OS & OS-versions. Need also a entitlement.
* Site	Resolves hostnames to IPs, used on the gateway.
* Appliance	Used for the appliance operation, working with 3d party systems like radius and AD.

== Cloud resolvers
* aws://
	security-group:<NAME>
  tag-key:<NAME>
  tag-value:<NAME>
  tag:<KEY>=<VALUE>
* azure://	network-security-group:<NAME>
  tag-key:<NAME>
  tag-value:<NAME>
  tag:<KEY>=<VALUE>

== VPNd
* :#> vpn-console [OPTIONS]

== Daemons
* Appliance 
  ** configd	Appliance config & seeding. Relates: managed
	** proxyd	Switchboard #1:{HTTPS,vpnd}; load balancing vpnd’s. 
	** nginx	Switchboard #2:{UI, cz-daemon}
	** rsyslog	Combines all logs.
	** logd	Forwards local rsyslog to remote; receiver on logserver. 
	** cz-ffwd	Forwards audit-logs from cz-logd and forwards messages securely to cz-logd on logserver.
	** cz-logd	Gathers the audit-logs from all the daemons running on the Appliance, and forwards then to rsyslog and logserver.
	** ssh	Handles ssh connections to the Appliance.
              
* Controller	controllerd	Handles all the authentication, authorization, Entitlements, Policies & Conditions, tokens, etc.

* Gateway	    
  ** Vpnd	Fw engine, creates tun device; 
	** Sessiond	  Handles entitlements, client claims, generates fw-rules. Relates: named
	** Named	    Translate names to IP: {DNS,aws, azure}
	** Had	      Client on appliance fail-over: {ipv4:arp, ipv6:ND}
  
* Audit log 	
  ** logd	parses the audit-logs and inserts them into elasticsearch.
	** Elastic	Database and processing.
	** Kibana	Audit log front end.
